# Movie Review Application

## Overview
This project is a full-stack web application developed using React, Node.js, and MySQL. It serves as a platform for users to search for movies, read and write reviews, and explore additional movie-related content. The application is designed to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of web development concepts, including client-server communication, database management, and responsive UI design.

## Key Features
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for movies by title, actor, and director. The search results display movie titles, directors, user reviews, and average review scores.
- **Review System**: A feature that allows users to read and write reviews for movies, contributing to the community-driven database of movie insights.
- **Scoreboard on MyPage**: A unique functionality that aggregates average user scores and displays the top movies for each genre, offering an interactive and engaging way for users to discover popular movies.
- **Personalized User Page**: A dedicated page for users that offers unique features like movie trailers, recommendations based on their reviews, and the latest movie news, in addition to the scoreboard feature.
- **Responsive Design**: The application uses Material UI for a consistent and responsive user interface across various devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Developed with React, leveraging client-side routing for seamless navigation between different components/pages.
- **Backend**: Node.js is used for the server-side logic, handling requests and responses between the frontend and the database.
- **Database**: MySQL is employed for data storage, including movie information, user reviews, and additional content.

## Development Process
- Utilized GitHub for version control, with regular commits and branching to manage different stages of development.
- Followed best practices in coding, including clear naming conventions, modular design, and comprehensive commenting.
- Implemented Material UI for a cohesive and user-friendly interface design.
- Ensured cross-platform compatibility and responsive design for an optimal user experience on various devices.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
- npm install

3. Set up the MySQL database and configure the connection settings in the application.
4. Start the Node.js server:
- node server.js

5. Launch the React application:
- npm start

6. The application should now be running on `localhost:3000`.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement additional features such as social media integration, advanced movie recommendations based on machine learning algorithms, and user profile customization.
- Enhance the search functionality with more filters and sorting options.
- Improve the mobile user experience with a dedicated mobile app or a more responsive mobile web design.
